# Assignments

## Assignment 1:
1. __Palindrome Generator__:
   - Given a string or a number, return a palindrome twice the length of the input.  
2. __Character Counter__:
   - **P1.** Counts repetitions of the characters and stores the information about the repetitions in a dictionary 
   - **P2.** Counts repetitions of the characters and stores the information of only those repetitions which are equal to or greater than 2 in a dictionary.

## Assignment 2:
1. __Decoding a palindrome__:
   - **P1.** Given a palindrome, retrieve the original string/number.
   - **P2.** Given a sentence with palindromes which is nothing but encrypted information, retrieve the message
   
2. __Character Count Encrpytion__: 
   - **P1.** Given a string/number/sentence obtain the repetitions, and convert the given input message into a code that contains just the characters in the original string but not repeated.
   - **P2.** Given a string/number/sentence obtain a code that contains the characters/digits in the original string followed by the number of repetitions seen in the string. 
   
   
## Assignment 3:

1. __Encryption a list of randomly generated words__:
   - **P1.** Given number of characters in the string, obtain a randomly generated string.
   - **P2.** Write a function to loop over and encrypt any specified number of randomly generated strings using any of the previously developed encryption methods.
   
2. __Space-time complexity analysis: Simplified__:
   - **P1.** Estimate the time taken for each function written above and plot them as a function of the input string length. Say whether the graph is linear or not. If so, reason.
   - **P2.** Estimate the amount of space occupied by the variables as a function of the input size.
   
   
## Assignment 4:

1. __Modules and packages__:
   - **P1.** Convert the above written codes into streamlined modules that can be imported into a main file and perform required operations.
   - **P2.** Write an application with a preliminary terminal user interface 
2. __Doc strings and comments__:
   - **P1** Given the codes developed earlier, write the doc strings for more readability.

## This course includes:
1. Hands on Labs using Colab Notebooks.(Soon to be uploaded)
2. Lecture notes on specific computer science concepts(Soon to be uploaded)
3. Road map to continue learning and building with Python. (Soon to be uploaded)
4. Links to useful open source resources and packages (Soon to be uploaded)
